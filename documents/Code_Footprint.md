## Setup

Final code footprint depends on many factors, such as target compiler, compilation flags; e.g. with or without code optimization, used applications, third-party crypto library to support the shielded communication, usage of the shielded communication itself, or I<sup>2</sup>C frame buffer size. 
For all measurements optimization level "-Os" has been selected. The setup without optimization might take up to 100% of the showed here code footprint

## How to optimize

The Software Framework offers a way to optimize the final code footprint depending on the use case. Below are the security chip features which you might want to control (the features of the chip itself aren't blocked, inmaster/code is compiled excluding/including selected options).

## Shielded Communication

The [OPTIGA_COMMS_SHIELDED_CONNECTION](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-charge/blob/master/optiga/include/optiga/optiga_lib_config.h#L96) macro enables or disables the shielded communication. Don't forget to excluded the pal_crypt provider; e.g. [pal_crypt_mbedtls.c](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-charge/blob/master/pal/pal_crypt_mbedtls.c), from your build together with the crypto library; e.g.[mbedtls](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/tree/master/externals/mbedtls), if it's not used in your project.
